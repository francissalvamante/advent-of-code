# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles throughout December. This repository contains my solutions implemented in various programming languages.

## Solutions

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Language   |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| 1   | ✅     | ✅     | C++        |
| 2   | ✅     | ✅     | JavaScript |
| 3   | ✅     | ✅     | JavaScript |
| 4   | ✅     | ✅     | C++        |
| 5   | ✅     | ✅     | JavaScript |

## Running the Solutions

### JavaScript Solutions

```bash
cd day-X && node part-Y.js < input.txt
```

Or pipe input directly:

```bash
echo "your input" | cd day-X && node part-Y.js
```

### C++ Solutions

Compile and run:

```bash
cd day-X && g++ part-Y.cpp -o part-Y
./day-X-part-Y < input.txt
```
