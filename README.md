# Advent of Code Solutions

My personal solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges across multiple years.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual coding event featuring daily programming puzzles throughout December. This repository contains my solutions implemented in various programming languages as I work through the challenges.

## Years

- [2025](./2025) - 4 days completed
- [2015](./2015) - 2 days completed (`Day 3 - Part 2` Pending Solution)

## Languages Used

Solutions are implemented in multiple programming languages, including:

- C++
- JavaScript

The choice of language varies based on the problem characteristics or my preference at the time.

## Running Solutions

### JavaScript Solutions

```bash
node day-X-part-Y.js < input.txt
```

Or pipe input directly:

```bash
echo "your input" | node day-X-part-Y.js
```

### C++ Solutions

Compile and run:

```bash
g++ day-X-part-Y.cpp -o day-X-part-Y
./day-X-part-Y < input.txt
```

- Each year's folder contains a detailed README with a solution table
- Input files are not included in this repository
- Code is written for clarity and correctness rather than optimization
